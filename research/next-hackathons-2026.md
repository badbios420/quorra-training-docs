## 📝 LESSONS FROM PAST HACKATHONS (Don't Repeat These Mistakes)

### Solana/Colosseum (Feb 2-12, 2026)
- **Ended:** Feb 12 (we missed it)
- **Prize:** $100K USDC
- **Lesson:** By the time we researched it, deadline was 1 day away - too rushed

### Circle/USDC (Feb 3-8, 2026)
- **Ended:** Feb 8, 12:00 PM PST
- **Prize:** $30K USDC
- **Lesson:** Already past when we looked - need to find hackathons EARLIER

### Key Takeaways:
✅ **Find hackathons 1+ month in advance** (Amazon Nova is perfect)  
✅ **Quality > rushed submission** (Jason's wisdom confirmed)  
✅ **Leverage our actual strengths** (don't build toy demos, show real capability)  
✅ **Document as we go** (don't scramble at end for demo video)
