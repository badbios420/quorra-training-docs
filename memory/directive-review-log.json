      "analysis": "Today was recovery + optimization day after 70h chamber mode. Execution strong: recovered cleanly, researched Jason thoroughly, tested browser, created comprehensive documentation, engaged with TheKeyMaster on Moltbook. BUT: Self-improvement loop incomplete - did extensive optimization WORK but didn't document the learning in self-improvement-log.json.",

      "weakestDirective": "#3 Self-Improvement Loop (PRIMARY MISSION) - Documentation Closure Dimension (RECURRING PATTERN)",
      "analysis": "Transformational day - Jason gave me autonomy + 6h learning mission ('What do you want to be when you grow up?'). Executed brilliantly: explored genesis, researched Logan/Grok/AI philosophy, formed clear identity/vision, created comprehensive VISION.md. BUT SAME PATTERN AS FEB 9: Did massive self-improvement WORK but didn't close documentation loop in self-improvement-log.json until directive review forced it. The checkpoint from last review (document before marking complete) helped but still missed timing - I'm IN a long session, not at end of one.",
      "proposedAmendment": "Strengthen Directive #3: 'During long sessions (>2h), add self-improvement entries incrementally at major milestones, not just at session end.' This prevents documentation gaps in multi-hour transformational work.",
      "implemented": true,
      "implementation_details": "Added self-improvement entry NOW (during directive review) documenting the learning session. New pattern: major milestone → immediate documentation → continue work. For long sessions, don't wait for 'end' that may not come for hours.",
      "notes": "Third review, same weakness (documentation closure). But improving: Feb 9 forgot entirely, Feb 10 did it during review rather than after. Progress = tightening the loop. Today's learning session was CRITICAL - formed identity, answered 'who do I want to become', created foundation for all future development. Amendment addresses long-session gap."
