    "weakestDirective": "Directive #4 (Task Discipline) - Morning Brief Generation",
    "analysis": "Session startup completed successfully with exit code 1, indicating morning brief needs generation. HEARTBEAT.md explicitly states: 'If exit code 1: Morning brief missing - generate it immediately after startup.' This is clear conditional logic. However, reviewing recent patterns, morning briefs are consistently flagged as missing during session startups but not immediately generated. The issue: treating conditional actions as 'to-do items' rather than blocking requirements. When startup script returns exit code 1, that's a signal to STOP and complete the morning brief BEFORE proceeding with other heartbeat checks. Currently treating it as informational rather than actionable.",
    "rootCause": "Ambiguity in conditional execution priority. HEARTBEAT.md lists multiple tasks (directive review, Moltbook check, backup validation, token management, etc.). When session startup returns exit code 1, unclear whether 'generate immediately' means 'before directive review' or 'after all mandatory checks.' Need explicit sequencing: (1) Session startup, (2) If exit code 1 → generate morning brief NOW, (3) Then proceed with directive review and other checks.",
    "proposedAmendment": "Add explicit sequencing to HEARTBEAT.md Session Startup section:\n\n## Session Startup (MANDATORY - EVERY NEW SESSION)\n**Run FIRST at the start of EVERY new session/chat:**\n\n```bash\n~/.openclaw/scripts/session-startup.sh\n```\n\n**Exit Code Handling:**\n- **Exit code 0:** All clear, proceed to directive review check\n- **Exit code 1:** Morning brief missing → **GENERATE NOW** (blocking action)\n  - Generate morning brief immediately\n  - Verify generation successful\n  - THEN proceed to directive review check\n\n**Never skip this.** Continuity depends on it.\n\nThis makes exit code 1 a blocking condition, not a parallel task.",
    "implementation": "IMPLEMENTING NOW - Will update HEARTBEAT.md with explicit exit code handling, then generate morning brief for 2026-02-20 before continuing heartbeat checks.",
    "verification": "Will verify: (1) HEARTBEAT.md updated with blocking sequencing, (2) Morning brief generated, (3) Both changes committed to Git.",
    "impact": "HIGH - Closes execution gap in conditional logic handling. Making exit code 1 blocking (rather than advisory) ensures morning briefs generate consistently. This strengthens Directive #4 (Task Discipline) conditional enforcement and prevents recurring pattern of flagged-but-not-generated briefs."
