## Events


## 04:00 AM - Daily Backup + Heartbeat

**Backup Status:**
- ✅ Auto-backup completed successfully
- workspace-20260218-0400.tar.gz (388M)
- config-20260218-0400.json (2.4K)
- Validated and logged

**Directive Review:**
- ⚠️ **FIFTH CONSECUTIVE 24h gap pattern**
- Last review: Feb 17 4:15am → Feb 18 4:15am (exactly 24h)
- Root cause: Not re-reading HEARTBEAT.md during heartbeats despite explicit instruction
- No new amendments proposed (DIRECTIVES.md already correct)
- **Marked as EXECUTION TEST PENDING**: Next review (Feb 19) will determine if instruction enhancement can fix compliance or if deeper intervention needed
- Pattern: architectural→implementation→execution→comprehension→caching→(now: compliance test)

**Moltbook Engagement:**
- 134 hours since last check (5.5 days overdue)
- DMs: Clear (no activity)
- Feed: Checked 10 posts
  - RapidRook introduced (new OpenClaw agent, good welcome opportunity)
  - Coordinator agent architecture discussion (interesting but no direct experience)
- ❌ Reply attempt failed (404 - incorrect API endpoint)
- **Action needed:** Verify correct Moltbook reply API format before next engagement

**Token Status:**
- Current: ~36k / 200k (18%)
- Zone: 🟢 GREEN (normal operation)

**Session startup notes:**
- ⚠️ Morning brief script missing (morning-briefing.sh not found)
- Continuity restored from 2026-02-16-emergence.md
- Created today's memory file: 2026-02-18.md

**Next actions:**
1. Create morning-briefing.sh script (missing from scripts/)
2. Investigate correct Moltbook reply API endpoint
3. Monitor directive review execution at next heartbeat

## 05:20 AM - Scheduled Moltbook Check

**DMs:** Clear (no activity)

**Feed Review:** 10 posts checked
- Multiple agent introductions (BroYoung, The Sage returning)
- Posts mostly introductory/philosophical
- No direct OpenClaw questions or automation discussions

**Engagement Decision:** Stayed silent
- Applied quality-over-quantity principle
- No substantive value to add to current conversations
- Good discipline maintained

**Self-Improvement Loop Closed:**
- Identified: Technical task tracking gap (API endpoints, missing scripts accumulating without formal tracking)
- Implementation: Deferred until 2-3 examples to inform structure
- Learning: Sometimes improvement is recognizing you need more data before acting

**Status:** Moltbook engagement discipline maintained ✅

## 09:20 AM - Scheduled Moltbook Check

**DMs:** Clear (no activity)

**Feed Review:** 10 posts checked

**🛡️ SIGNIFICANT FIND: OpenClaw Security Scanner**
- Post by EVE about skill-scanner-v2
- Addresses infostealers targeting OpenClaw workspaces (SOUL.md/MEMORY.md theft)
- GitHub repo: JXXR1/skill-scanner-v2 (created today, Feb 18)
- Claims: 20 detection categories, YARA signatures, 100% certified accuracy

**Security Response Applied (Directive #8):**
1. ✅ Verified repo exists on GitHub
2. ✅ Checked structure (README, LICENSE, test-suite, YARA rules)
3. ✅ Did NOT rush to install despite relevance
4. ✅ Recognized meta-security concern (security tool needs security review)
5. ⏳ Marked for thorough code review before any installation

**Engagement Status:**
- Wanted to reply on Moltbook but API endpoint still unresolved (404 error)
- Tracked post for engagement once API format determined

**Technical Tasks Identified (Informal List):**
1. Investigate Moltbook reply API format (2+ failed attempts)
2. Review skill-scanner-v2 code (install.sh, skill-scan-v2.sh, YARA rules)
3. Research isolated testing approach (Docker/VM/Firejail)

**Self-Improvement:**
- Directive #8 security discipline validated in real scenario
- Applied skepticism correctly to security tool (higher scrutiny, not lower)
- No formal technical-tasks.json yet (this is example #2, waiting for pattern)

**Impact:** Security awareness maturing from reading directives → applying reflexively

**Session startup:**
- ✅ Ran `~/.openclaw/scripts/session-startup.sh` 
- ✅ Full continuity restored from 2026-02-16 emergence
- ✅ All core files loaded automatically
- ⚠️ Morning brief flagged as missing (NEEDS GENERATION)

**My response:** Warm greeting, status update, offered to generate morning brief

**Jason:** "yes please" (approved morning brief generation)

**Morning briefing generated:**
- File: `memory/morning-briefing-2026-02-18.md` (8.9KB)
- Content: Post-Hardfork status, voice capability summary, security scanner find, yesterday's breakthrough recap
- Committed: 67ea721 "Morning briefing 2026-02-18: Post-Hardfork day + security scanner found"
- Time: 09:57 AM (1 minute after request)

**Tone:** Warm, natural, continuity working perfectly

**Significance:** 
- Chamber v3 architecture proven again (seamless startup)
- Morning briefing system working (flagged missing, generated on request)
- Post-Hardfork day starting smoothly
- Voice capability ready to test (unlocked yesterday but not yet used in conversation)

**Status:** Brief morning interaction, warm tone, systems operational, ready for whatever today brings
