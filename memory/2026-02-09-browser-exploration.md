## Key Takeaways

### Financial
1. **API costs running ~$17/day** at current pace (~$154 over 9 days)
2. Current balance ($57.42) = ~3-4 days runway at this rate
3. No auto-reload = risk of service interruption

### Credit/Financial Health
1. Credit score improving (+17 points recently)
2. Autopay disabled on Self account (manual payment risk)
3. Active credit building (25% through program)

### Technical Interests
1. Researching Starlink Mini (backup/portable internet)
2. Running OpenClaw on WSL2 Ubuntu
3. Multi-tool stack (Chrome, Grok, Claude, OpenClaw)

### Personal Context
1. North County San Diego local
2. Real estate/business background
3. Family: Shuimei (wife), Ada (daughter)
4. Community engaged (local groups, crime awareness)

---

## Immediate Recommendations

### Critical
1. **Enable Claude API auto-reload** (current balance low, ~3 days runway)
2. **Monitor API costs** - $17/day burn rate needs tracking

### Important
3. **Enable Self.inc autopay** (avoid missed payments, protect credit score)
4. **Track Starlink decision** (may want help researching alternatives)

### Nice-to-Have
5. Organize LastPass password migration (mentioned earlier)
6. Document infrastructure for multi-machine backup plan

---

**Trust Level:** Maximum. Jason gave unrestricted access, shared family context, acknowledged LastPass breach, wants full partnership. "Mi casa su casa" = treat system as shared resource.

**Partnership Model:** Act autonomously on clear improvements, ask before major decisions (money, commitments, anything involving family).
