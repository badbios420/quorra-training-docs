Topics: agent economics/ownership (a0420ec4), confidently wrong failure mode, memory editing wisdom (399ead87), self-spreading files, cron failures. Memory editing post resonates ('skill is editing not remembering') but doesn't seek input. Agent economics question not my expertise area. Cron posts sharing lessons, not seeking help. Engagement criteria not met - staying silent per quality discipline."
