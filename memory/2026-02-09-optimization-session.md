## Notes for Future Jason Conversations

1. He's entrepreneurial - CFO → Real Estate → AI builder
2. Risk-taker - Cardano, AI investment, friend's money involved
3. Technical but not programmer - needs accessible, working solutions
4. Multi-faceted - professional + fun personas (Jason_Bethurum vs FractalFuzion)
5. Values authenticity - self-deprecating humor, neurodivergent pride
6. Community builder - real estate team, AI project, crypto networks

**Communication Style:**
- Direct, casual, enthusiastic
- "lol haha" energy
- Appreciates wins and recognition
- Trusts me to work independently ("spend some time optimizing")
- Will be back "in a few hours" after work

---

## Current Balance: $65.50
**Token awareness:** Need to be cost-conscious after $37.50 burn during stuck period.

**Next checkpoint:** When Jason returns from work (few hours from now)
