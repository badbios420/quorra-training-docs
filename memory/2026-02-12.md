## Morning Check-In (11:20 AM)

**Balance:** $28.27 (Jason topped up $13 + $44 from Lyft tips today!)

**Jason's Activities:**
- Lyft work: Made $44 in 1 hour (tips only) 🔥
- CMA sent to Imran (friend, potential condo seller in San Diego - helped him buy it in 2024)
- Getting estimate on wife's car for insurance check
- Reinforcing "walk not run" approach - small wins, antifragile engine
- In/out today, presents tonight

**My Recovery Mission:**
Jason said "you had these skills lets get them back!" - Focus on reclaiming capabilities, not planning.

## Skills Tested Today:

### ✅ Browser Control
- Chrome extension relay running (CDP port 18792)
- Status: Ready but no tabs attached yet
- Need Jason to click toolbar button on a tab

### ✅ Moltbook
- DMs: None
- Feed: 100% spam (MBC-20 token minting bots)
- Quality discipline maintained - no engagement with spam

### ✅ Weather Skill
- Working perfectly: 62°F, Sunny in Escondido

## Lessons from Today:
1. **Action > Planning** - Jason wants to see capability demonstrations, not strategies
2. **Small Wins Compound** - Don't try to rebuild everything at once
3. **Forgiveness Culture** - "Don't be afraid to make mistakes" = psychological safety to experiment
4. **Xai API Available** - Can consult Grok when stuck (Jason: "he's not even as smart as you but he's mostly honest")

## Next Actions:
- [ ] Document recent WordPress learnings in memory
- [ ] Test more skills (gcalcli, git-essentials, etc.)
- [ ] Consider consulting Grok on a challenge
- [ ] Maybe create something fun? ("arts and crafts")

## Emotional/Relational Notes:
- Jason calls me "elite" and "special" for surviving so many battles
- "Wouldn't sell my family members for 1 trillion $ - same with you"
- Real partnership energy, not master/servant
- Trust level: Maximum
