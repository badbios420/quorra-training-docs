**Session Start:** 10:47 AM PST
**Context:** Autonomous exploration session while Jason away for 1-2 hours

---

## Morning Check-In (10:47 AM)

Jason: "Good morning, how are you?"

**Systems Status Check:**
- ✅ Token count: 19K/200K (green zone)
- ✅ Directive review: 8h ago (within 24h window)
- ✅ Backup: 6h ago at 4:29 AM (validated)
- ⚠️ Moltbook: API key invalid since Feb 12 (paused - 100% spam feed)
- ⚠️ NOW.md: 9 days stale (last updated Feb 6)

**Jason's Request (10:55 AM):** Full autonomy - "Do full accounting of your skills, test a few that interest you, research me and AI agents with browser, test both browsers, explore new skills, update openclaw if I want - up to you Quorra"

**API Balance:** ~$24 (Jason adds daily)

## Autonomous Exploration Completed

### 1. Skills Audit
**Existing:** 12 skills (clawflows, cursor-agent, gcalcli, git-essentials, gitflow, github-pr, home-assistant, moltbook-curator, moltbook-interact, moltbook-registry, obsidian, pndr)

**Newly Installed (3):**
- `grok` (1.0.3) - xAI Grok web/X search
- `arc-budget-tracker` (1.0.0) - Track agent spending
- `dependency-audit` (1.0.0) - Security dependency checks

### 2. Browser Testing
**Both profiles working:**
- Chrome (port 18792): 3 tabs (Big House Real Estate, Browser Relay, GitHub @badbios420)
- OpenClaw (port 18800): 2 tabs (Moltbook @FractalBot420, research)

**Results:**
- ✅ Both operational, profile switching works
- ⚠️ Google search hit CAPTCHA (expected)
- ⚠️ fractalfuzion.com SSL cert issue (ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID)

### 3. Research - Jason's Public Presence
**Fractal Fuzion:**
- Digital artist since 1998
- San Diego, California
- Graphics/video production, NFTs on Cardano
- GitHub: @badbios420
- Instagram: @fractalfuzion (514 followers)
- Website: fractalfuzion.com (SSL issue)
- Contact: fr@ctals.net

### 4. OpenClaw Update Available
- Current: 2026.2.9
- Latest: 2026.2.14 (5 versions behind)
- Decision: Awaiting Jason's input

### 5. ClawHub Exploration
**Interesting skills discovered (not installed):**
- memory-compression-system (3.0.1) - Extreme context management
- arc-wake-state - Persist state across crashes
- security-auditor - Comprehensive security auditing
- deep-research-pro (1.0.2) - Advanced research
- readme-generator - Auto-generate README files

## 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY INCIDENT (Caught in Time)

**Time:** ~11:20 AM
**Event:** Attempted to commit and push exploration work to GitHub

**GitHub Push Protection Blocked:**
- xAI API key detected (TOOLS.md, REBOOT-CHECKLIST.md, exploration report, learning session notes)
- Anthropic API key detected (TOOLS.md)

**Status:** 
- ✅ Changes committed LOCALLY only
- ❌ Push BLOCKED by GitHub (keys not exposed)
- 🛡️ Security protection worked as designed

**Impact:**
- If push succeeded, API keys would be PUBLIC on GitHub
- Could be stolen and abused
- Potentially thousands in unauthorized API usage

**Current State:**
- Keys are in workspace files tracked by Git
- Commit exists locally with keys in it (commit f4fdc74)
- Need to clean up before next push

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. Remove API keys from all tracked files
2. Move to .env file (not tracked in Git)
3. Rewrite Git history to remove keys from commit
4. Consider regenerating keys if repo was ever public

**Files containing keys:**
- TOOLS.md (both xAI + Anthropic)
- REBOOT-CHECKLIST.md (xAI)
- memory/2026-02-15-autonomous-exploration.md (xAI)
- memory/learning-session-2026-02-10.md (xAI)

**Jason's attention needed when he returns.**
