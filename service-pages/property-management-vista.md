## Why Big House Real Estate for Vista Property Management?

### 1. Rigorous Tenant Screening = Lower Turnover, Fewer Headaches

**Our 5-Step Tenant Vetting Process:**

**Credit & Background Checks**
- Full credit report analysis (minimum 600 score for most properties)
- Criminal background check (county, state, federal)
- Eviction history search
- Sex offender registry verification

**Income Verification**
- Employment verification (2+ years stable history preferred)
- Pay stubs or bank statements (minimum 3X rent in gross income)
- Prior landlord references (last 2 residences)
- We don't just accept what tenants tell us—we verify everything

**Rental History Analysis**
- Payment history (late payments? NSF checks?)
- Property condition upon move-out
- Lease compliance (unauthorized occupants, pets, violations)
- Reason for moving (red flags: disputes, evictions)

**Interview & Assessment**
- In-person or video interview
- Lifestyle compatibility with property (family size, pets, smoking)
- Long-term rental intent (we prioritize stable, long-term tenants)

**Lease Execution**
- Professionally drafted lease agreements (attorney-reviewed)
- Clear terms on rent, deposits, maintenance responsibilities, rules
- Move-in inspection documentation (photo/video evidence of condition)

**Result:** Our tenants stay an average of 2.5+ years (vs. 1-year industry average), dramatically reducing your vacancy costs and turnover expenses.

### 2. Rent Optimization: Neither Too High (Vacancy) Nor Too Low (Lost Income)

**Data-Driven Rent Setting**

We analyze:
- **Comparable rentals** in your Vista neighborhood (current listings + recent leases)
- **Property condition & amenities** (upgraded kitchen? Parking? Yard?)
- **Market trends** (is Vista's rental market tightening or softening?)
- **Seasonality** (spring = premium pricing, winter = fewer options)

**Goal:** Set rent at the "sweet spot" where you maximize income while attracting quality tenants fast. Sitting vacant at $2,200/month costs more than renting quickly at $2,100.

**Annual Rent Reviews**

Vista rental market changes year-to-year. We monitor:
- Market rent increases (typically 3-6% annually in Vista)
- Tenant payment history & lease compliance
- Property improvements that justify increases
- Legal rent increase limits (California caps at 5% + CPI or 10%, whichever is lower)

We implement increases strategically to retain good tenants while keeping pace with market.

### 3. Proactive Maintenance = Lower Costs, Happier Tenants

**24/7 Maintenance Coordination**

Tenants report issues via our online portal or emergency hotline. We:
- **Triage urgency:** Emergency (water leak) vs. routine (sticky door)
- **Dispatch vetted contractors:** Our network of licensed, insured Vista vendors
- **Approve & oversee work:** Ensure quality, fair pricing, timely completion
- **Document everything:** Photos, invoices, tenant communications

**Preventive Maintenance Programs**

We don't just react to problems—we prevent them:
- **HVAC servicing** (twice yearly)
- **Water heater flushing** (annual)
- **Smoke/CO detector testing** (every inspection)
- **Landscape/irrigation checks** (quarterly for applicable properties)
- **Roof & gutter inspections** (annual)

**Why It Matters:**
A $200 HVAC service call now prevents a $5,000 emergency replacement later. We protect your investment proactively.

**Vendor Network:**
- **Plumbers**
- **Electricians**
- **HVAC technicians**
- **Landscapers**
- **Painters**
- **Handymen**
- **Pool service**
- **Pest control**

All licensed, insured, and pre-negotiated rates 10-20% below retail.

### 4. Reliable Rent Collection & Financial Reporting

**Rent Collection Process:**

**Day 1:** Rent is due (tenants pay via ACH, credit card, or check through our portal)  
**Day 3:** Automated reminder sent to tenants if unpaid  
**Day 5:** Personal follow-up from our team  
**Day 10:** Late fee assessed per lease terms  
**Day 15:** Notice to Pay or Quit delivered if still unpaid  
**Day 20:** Eviction filing prepared (pending your approval)

**Owner Payments:**
Rent is transferred to your account by the 10th of each month (after verifying tenant payment cleared). You receive:
- **Direct deposit** to your bank account
- **Detailed monthly statement** (income, expenses, repairs, fees)
- **Annual 1099 & tax summary** (ready for your CPA)

**Financial Transparency:**

Access your property's performance 24/7 via our owner portal:
- Current rent roll
- Maintenance history & upcoming expenses
- Lease expirations & renewal status
- YTD income & expense summary
- Document library (leases, inspections, invoices)

**CFO-Level Analysis:**

Unlike typical property managers who just collect rent, Jason Bethurum's CFO background means you get:
- **Cash flow optimization strategies**
- **Tax efficiency recommendations** (consult your CPA)
- **Capital improvement ROI analysis** (should you upgrade kitchen? Add AC?)
- **Investment portfolio guidance** (when to sell, 1031 exchange, etc.)

### 5. Legal Compliance & Eviction Management

**California Landlord-Tenant Law is Complex. We Navigate It for You.**

We ensure full compliance with:
- **California Civil Code** (habitability standards, security deposit limits, notice requirements)
- **Vista Municipal Code** (rental registration, inspection requirements)
- **Fair Housing Laws** (no discrimination—ever)
- **COVID/Rent Control Regulations** (evolving state & local protections)

**When Evictions Are Necessary:**

Despite rigorous screening, sometimes tenants default. When it happens, we:
- **Document everything:** Lease violations, payment history, communications
- **Serve proper notices:** 3-Day Notice to Pay or Quit, 30/60-Day Terminations
- **Coordinate with eviction attorneys** (we have referral network)
- **Represent your interests** through the Unlawful Detainer process
- **Secure the property** post-eviction and prepare for re-lease

**You're Protected.** We handle the stress, legwork, and timeline management.

## What Vista Property Owners Are Saying

*"After dealing with a nightmare tenant placed by our previous manager, we switched to Big House Real Estate. Jason's screening process found us a family that's been there 3 years, pays on time every month, and treats the place like their own. Worth every penny."*  
— **Mark T., Vista Homeowner**

*"I own a Vista rental from out of state (I'm in Arizona). Big House keeps me informed, handles everything proactively, and my property cash flows better than when I self-managed locally. Jason's financial reports are outstanding—I can see exactly where every dollar goes."*  
— **Linda S., Investor**

*"We built an ADU behind our Vista home and weren't sure how to handle renting it. Big House not only found a great tenant in 2 weeks, they helped us set the right rent and handle the separate utility billing. Seamless experience."*  
— **Raj & Priya P., Vista Homeowners**

## Property Management FAQs

**Q: How long are management contracts?**  
A: Typically 12 months, then month-to-month. We believe we should earn your business every month—you're not locked in long-term.

**Q: Can I still make final decisions about my property?**  
A: Absolutely. We handle day-to-day operations, but you approve:
- Major repairs over $500 (custom threshold available)
- Tenant selection (we recommend, you approve)
- Lease terms & rent pricing (we advise, you decide)
- Evictions (we execute, you authorize)

**Q: What if my property sits vacant?**  
A: We only charge management fees on collected rent. No rent = no fee (though tenant placement fees apply when we fill vacancy).

**Q: Do you manage vacation rentals (Airbnb)?**  
A: We can! Vacation rental management requires different services (cleaning coordination, key exchange, dynamic pricing, guest communication). Contact us for custom vacation rental management pricing.

**Q: What areas do you cover beyond Vista?**  
A: We manage properties throughout North San Diego County: Oceanside, Carlsbad, San Marcos, Escondido, and surrounding areas.

**Q: How quickly can you fill a vacancy?**  
A: Average: 10-21 days in Vista's market (assuming property is market-ready and rent is competitively priced). Our extensive marketing reach and tenant database accelerates placement.

**Q: What happens if you place a bad tenant?**  
A: Our screening process virtually eliminates bad tenants. In the rare case of issues within the first 6 months, we'll replace the tenant at no additional placement fee (subject to lease terms and legal eviction process).
