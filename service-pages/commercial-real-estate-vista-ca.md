## Commercial Real Estate FAQs

**Q: How much does it cost to hire a commercial real estate agent?**
A: For tenants: FREE. Landlords pay our commission. For buyers: typically 2-3% of purchase price (negotiable). For sellers: 4-6% of sale price (split with buyer's agent).

**Q: What's the difference between gross and triple-net leases?**
A: Gross leases include most expenses in base rent. Triple-net (NNN) leases require tenants to pay property taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance on top of base rent. NNN leases are most common for Vista commercial properties.

**Q: Can I convert a commercial property to residential in Vista?**
A: Possibly, depending on zoning. Vista's downtown area encourages mixed-use and adaptive reuse. We can help navigate zoning analysis and entitlement process.

**Q: What's a typical Vista commercial lease term?**
A: 3-5 years for office, 5-10 years for retail, 5-7 years for industrial. Longer terms often come with tenant improvement allowances and rent escalations.

**Q: Should I buy or lease commercial space for my Vista business?**
A: Depends on your:
- **Capital availability:** Buying requires 20-30% down + reserves
- **Business stability:** Buying makes sense if you're established and plan to stay 7+ years
- **Tax situation:** Ownership offers depreciation benefits
- **Flexibility needs:** Leasing provides easier exit if business changes

We'll analyze your specific situation and recommend the best path.
