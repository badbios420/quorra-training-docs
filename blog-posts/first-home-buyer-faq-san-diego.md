# Top 10 Questions About Buying Your First Home in San Diego

Buying your first home in San Diego is exciting but can feel overwhelming. With median home prices around $850K and a competitive market, first-time buyers need clear answers to navigate successfully. Here are the top 10 questions we hear from first-time homebuyers in San Diego County.

## 1. How much do I need for a down payment?

**Answer:** Not as much as you think! While 20% down is ideal, many first-time buyer programs require only 3-5%:

- **FHA Loans:** 3.5% down
- **Conventional 97:** 3% down for qualified buyers
- **VA Loans:** 0% down for eligible veterans
- **USDA Loans:** 0% down for qualifying rural areas

For a $600K home (entry-level in San Diego), that's $18K-$30K instead of $120K.

**Important:** Lower down payments mean higher monthly payments and mortgage insurance (PMI). Calculate your comfort level.

## 2. What credit score do I need?

**Answer:** Minimum scores vary by loan type:

- **FHA:** 580+ (580-619 requires 10% down)
- **Conventional:** 620+ minimum, 740+ for best rates
- **VA:** No official minimum (lenders typically want 620+)
- **USDA:** 640+ typically

**San Diego tip:** With competitive bidding, stronger credit scores (740+) give you more negotiating power and lower interest rates.

## 3. How much house can I afford?

**Answer:** Use the 28/36 rule as a starting point:

- **28% rule:** Housing costs (PITI - principal, interest, taxes, insurance) shouldn't exceed 28% of gross monthly income
- **36% rule:** Total debt (including housing) shouldn't exceed 36% of gross income

**Example:** $100K annual income = $8,333/month gross
- Max housing: $2,333/month
- Max total debt: $3,000/month

**Reality check:** San Diego's high prices mean many buyers stretch to 30-35% for housing. Talk to a lender about debt-to-income ratios and comfortable payment levels.

## 4. What's the difference between pre-qualified and pre-approved?

**Answer:**

**Pre-qualification** = soft estimate based on self-reported information (not verified)

**Pre-approval** = lender verifies income, assets, credit, and issues conditional approval letter

**In San Diego's market:** Pre-approval is *essential*. Sellers won't take your offer seriously without it. Get fully underwritten pre-approval for strongest position.

## 5. Should I buy a condo, townhome, or single-family home?

**Answer:** Depends on budget, lifestyle, and investment goals:

**Condos ($400K-$600K):**
- Pros: Lower entry cost, amenities, less maintenance
- Cons: HOA fees ($200-$500+/month), restrictions, potential special assessments

**Townhomes ($550K-$750K):**
- Pros: More space than condos, small yard, community
- Cons: HOA fees, shared walls, less privacy

**Single-Family Homes ($700K+):**
- Pros: Privacy, land ownership, appreciation potential
- Cons: Higher cost, full maintenance responsibility

**San Diego consideration:** HOA fees are common. Factor them into affordability calculations.

## 6. What neighborhoods are best for first-time buyers?

**Answer:** These areas offer relative affordability with good amenities:

**South Bay (Chula Vista, National City):** $500K-$650K
- Good schools, family-friendly, diverse communities
- 20-30 min commute to downtown

**East County (El Cajon, Santee, Lakeside):** $550K-$700K
- More space for your money, newer developments
- Warmer climate, 30-40 min commute

**North County (Vista, San Marcos, Escondido):** $600K-$750K
- Growing job market, excellent schools
- 30-45 min to coast, family-oriented

**Avoid these mistakes:** Don't sacrifice commute for affordability if you'll hate the drive. Visit neighborhoods at different times before deciding.

## 7. What closing costs should I expect?

**Answer:** Budget 2-5% of purchase price for closing costs:

**Typical costs:**
- Loan origination fees: 0.5-1%
- Appraisal: $500-$700
- Title insurance: $1,000-$2,000
- Escrow fees: $1,000-$2,000
- Home inspection: $400-$600
- HOA transfer fees: $200-$500
- Property taxes (prorated): varies
- Homeowners insurance (first year): $800-$1,500

**Example:** $600K home = $12,000-$30,000 closing costs

**Negotiation tip:** In buyer's markets, ask sellers to contribute to closing costs. In seller's markets (like San Diego), you'll likely pay your own.

## 8. How competitive is the San Diego market?

**Answer:** Very competitive, though it varies by price point and season:

**Reality in 2026:**
- Multiple offers common on well-priced homes
- Homes under $700K receive highest competition
- Typical time on market: 10-20 days for desirable properties
- Offer escalation clauses increasingly common

**Success strategies:**
- Get fully pre-approved before house hunting
- Write clean offers (minimal contingencies)
- Include personal letter to sellers (sometimes helps)
- Be ready to act fast (see it today, offer tomorrow)

## 9. Do I need an inspection?

**Answer:** **YES.** Even in competitive markets, don't skip the home inspection.

**What inspectors find:**
- Roof issues ($5K-$25K repairs)
- Plumbing problems ($1K-$10K)
- Electrical hazards ($500-$5K)
- Foundation concerns ($3K-$30K+)
- HVAC problems ($3K-$8K)

**Negotiation approach:**
- Include inspection contingency (7-10 days standard)
- Request repairs or credits for major issues
- Walk away if problems are too expensive

**San Diego specific:** Older homes near coast often have moisture/mold issues. Inspect thoroughly.

## 10. Should I use a buyer's agent?

**Answer:** **Absolutely YES.** Here's why:

**Buyer agents:**
- Cost you nothing (sellers pay commission)
- Negotiate better deals
- Handle complex paperwork
- Identify red flags you'd miss
- Recommend trusted inspectors/lenders
- Navigate multiple-offer situations

**What to look for:**
- Local market expertise (knows neighborhoods)
- First-time buyer experience
- Strong negotiation skills
- Responsive communication
- Patience (no pressure tactics)
