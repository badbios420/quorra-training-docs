## ⚠️ What Still Needs Configuration

### High Priority
1. **Web Search** - Needs Brave API key
   ```bash
   openclaw configure --section web
   ```
   Then set BRAVE_API_KEY

2. **Telegram Channels** (You mentioned 2)
   - Need to test/configure these
   - Where are they configured?

3. **Chrome Extension** (for logged-in accounts)
   - Option A: Sign into Chrome on Linux (where OpenClaw runs)
   - Option B: Connect from Windows side
   - Your call - both work!
